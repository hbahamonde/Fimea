Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky) predicts that:
	•	Loss frames lead to risk-seeking behavior.
	•	Gain/neutral frames lead to risk-averse behavior.

Rule of Rescue Frame = Loss Frame

This frame makes the problem urgent and personal (last-resort cancer drug). According to Prospect Theory:
	•	People become risk-seeking → more support for high-cost/high-reward options.
	•	In the graph: Blue bar increases (more respondents support unconditional public funding, even without a price cut).
	•	Red bar shrinks → fewer people reject funding altogether.
	•	Green bar slightly changes or shifts but stays secondary.

Utility Maximizing Frame = Neutral/Gain Frame

This is a cost-efficiency frame. According to Prospect Theory:
	•	People become risk-averse: prefer lower-cost or no-risk options.
	•	In the graph: red bar increases (more people reject the treatment---risk-averse stance).
	•	Green bar also increases: people only support the drug if price is lowered (conditional support = risk control).
	•	Blue bar decreases: fewer support unconditional adoption (risky).
